# Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) - Personal Implementation Attempt

This project is inspired by the [Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10524).

I had fun trying to create this architecture, though I couldn't get far because of the complexity (KV caching and expert routing I couldn't manage to implement).
